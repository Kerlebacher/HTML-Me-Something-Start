            <h2>Luau</h2>
            <p>One of the first things we did in Hawaii was partake in a Luau. We were invited to a beautiful cliff side with an amazing view of part of the island. They had a large stage setup and a variety of preactivities to go to while each guest checked in and found their seats. These preactivities included a fake tatoo drawn in oil based ink in the form of a traditional island design, a cooking demonstaration and a weaving demonstation. When all the guests were seated, we enjoyed a buffet styple meal and then watched the dancing performance. The performance showed us all the traditional male and female dances from all around polonesian cultural such as Hawaii, New Zeland and Samoan. WE had a wonderful evening and learned a lot about polonesian culture.</p>
