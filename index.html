      <p>We visited Honolulu on our recent trip to Hawaiʻi. The weather was a perfect 68 to 72 degrees Farenheit while we vacationed. We only caught rain on the day we were leaving. It was the perfect vacation. During our trip we did a variety of activities. Check them out!</p>

            <h2>Luau</h2>
            <p>One of the first things we did in Hawaii was partake in a Luau. We were invited to a beautiful cliff side with an amazing view of part of the island. They had a large stage setup and a variety of preactivities to go to while each guest checked in and found their seats. These preactivities included a fake tatoo drawn in oil based ink in the form of a traditional island design, a cooking demonstaration and a weaving demonstation. When all the guests were seated, we enjoyed a buffet styple meal and then watched the dancing performance. The performance showed us all the traditional male and female dances from all around polonesian cultural such as Hawaii, New Zeland and Samoan. We had a wonderful evening and learned a lot about polonesian culture.</p>

            <h2>ATV Riding at Kualoa Ranch</h2>
            <p>Established in 1850, Kualoa is a 4,000-acre private nature reserve and working cattle ranch, as well as a popular tourist attraction and filming location on the windward coast of Oʻahu in Hawaiʻi. We choose to participate in the ATV tour of Kualoa Ranch. My husband and I both drove an ATV through the terrain of the ranch. We were told to follow closely to the the ATV in front of us as the route could be a bit dangerous if you went through the wrong pot hole and could end up falling off a cliff or flipping the ATV. We saw beautiful views of the ocean, mountains, valleys and of course drove past the cattle they raise at the ranch. </p>
